{"name":"On the optimization of gluconeogenesis by thermophilic species","tagline":"This project contains all technical details surrounding the theoretical component of the honours report by DM Todt","body":"## Welcome to the online repository for all theoretical undertakings regarding my honours thesis\r\nThis project was completed in partial fulfillment of my BSc. (honours) degree in Biochemistry. The repository contains all python code used in the development of a suitable optimization algorithm for the model by _Kouril et al._ (available [here](http://jjj.bio.vu.nl/models/kouril3/)). The optimized model has been uploaded to the JWS Online biological systems database (available [here](http://jjj.bio.vu.nl/models/kouril3/)). This repository also includes any additional technical information regarding the project which may be deemed useful by moderators, or may otherwise be interesting to external readers.\r\n\r\n### Contents\r\n* **Monte Carlo_levenberg marquardt optimization.ipynb** - The complete optimization algorithm for the model available in a user-friendly readable format.\r\n* **Monte Carlo_levenberg marquardt optimization.py** - A copy of the complete optimization algorithm for the model available as an executable python script.\r\n* **Optimisation pseudocode.pdf** - The complete algorithm represented as pseudocode for readers not specifically familiar with the python programming language.\r\n* **DM Todt - Thesis.pdf** - My complete honours thesis, available in PDF format.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was completed by Davis Marshall Todt, a BSc. (honours) Biochemistry candidate at Stellenbosch University, South Africa. The project commenced in August 2015 and was completed October 31st.
